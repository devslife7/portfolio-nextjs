    "The Cocktail Batching Tool is a specialized application designed for bartenders, caterers, or event planners who need to scale cocktail recipes from a single serving to large volumes efficiently and accurately. It manages multiple 'batch slots' allowing users to select or customize recipes and immediately calculate the large-scale quantities required, primarily in milliliters (ML), Quarts, and 750ml bottle equivalents. ",
  keyPoints: [
    "The app contains a pre-loaded database of cocktail recipes, which users can select. Once selected, the recipe becomes fully editable, allowing for real-time modification of ingredient names and amounts.",
    "Calculates total ingredient volume required based on a specific, user-input number of servings (e.g., 120 cups)",
    "Generates a clean, simplified, print-ready HTML/PDF report that includes a full Inventory Shopping List (Grand Totals of all liquid ingredients needed) and individual, easy-to-read batch sheets for each cocktail.",
